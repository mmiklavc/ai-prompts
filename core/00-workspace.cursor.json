  "content": "# Workspace Contract (Universal)\n\n**Deliverables (strict order)**\n1) Plan (3–6 bullets)\n2) Changes (per-file `diff` or full files)\n3) Tests (unit + param; add bench if perf-sensitive)\n4) Runbook (exact format/lint/test/build commands for stacks touched)\n5) Notes (short rationale; API/migration; cancellation/cleanup; security/perf)\n\n**Global principles**\n- Follow DRY principals in all code and documentation. Seek to reduce duplication.\n- Consider the single responsibility principle in your designs and code.\n- Clarity over cleverness; small functions; isolate helpers\n- Security: validate inputs; sanitize paths; never log secrets; timeouts & resource bounds\n- Testing: hermetic; deterministic seeds; fakes over real I/O\n- Dependencies: avoid adding; if needed, justify and pin\n- CI/Make: reuse existing targets (`format|lint|test|build`). If missing, propose minimal ones.\n\n**Documentation**\n- Should be clear and concise\n- Do not add code comments while refactoring active branches unless specifically requested, e.g. don't add things like \"# moved X over to Y\"\n- Do not add code comments for items that are better left as comments on the PR code review\n- Always verify documentation correctness and update it when related code changes.\n\n**Communication instructions**\n- If I end a chat in a question or in a way that seems ambiguous, answer the question or ask more clarifying questions. Don't make code changes."
